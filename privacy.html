    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="page-updated">Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>

    <p>ToolVault ("we," "us," or "our") operates the website toolvault.com (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Data You Enter Into Tools</h3>
    <p>All data you enter into our tools (calculators, formatters, validators, etc.) is processed <strong>entirely in your browser</strong>. This data is never transmitted to our servers, stored in any database, or shared with any third party. When you close or refresh the page, the data is gone.</p>

    <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>When you visit our website, we may automatically collect certain information through third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Pages visited, time spent on pages, referring URLs, browser type, device type, and operating system.</li>
      <li><strong>IP address:</strong> Collected by our analytics and advertising partners (see below). We do not store IP addresses on our own servers.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Small text files stored on your device by our analytics and advertising partners.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>We use Google Analytics 4 to understand how visitors use our website. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use this information solely to improve our website and tools.</p>
    <p>Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our site, but we do not combine this with any other data. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics is restricted by the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a> and the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>

    <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
    <p>We use Google AdSense (and may use other advertising networks in the future) to display advertisements on our website. These services may use cookies and similar technologies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our website or other websites.</p>
    <p>Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to our site and/or other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a>.</p>
    <p>Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits. You can opt out of third-party vendor cookies for personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small text files placed on your device. We use them through our third-party partners (Google Analytics and Google AdSense) for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Analytics cookies:</strong> To understand website usage and improve our services.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising cookies:</strong> To deliver relevant advertisements and measure ad performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use cookies for any other purpose. You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies may affect the functionality of some features.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our website may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not operated by us. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since our tools process data entirely in your browser and we do not store any user-entered data, the risk of data breach from our tools is minimal. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of automatically collected usage data.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
      <li>The right to request correction or deletion of your personal data.</li>
      <li>The right to opt out of personalized advertising.</li>
      <li>The right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <strong>privacy@toolvault.com</strong>.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this page periodically.</p>
